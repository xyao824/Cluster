As part of the business benchmarking, the current dashboard for small and medium-sized en-terprises (SME) provides a good overview of how their business performing based on datafrom the connected applications.  
Other research shows that SME would like to see how theyare performing against similar businesses.  To be able to benchmark,  they want to establisha function that makes comparable businesses for each metrics.  More generally, 9Spokes Ltdwants to investigate some suitable approaches that allow their customers to better understandhow their company performance compared with others. The 9Spokes platform provides a largeamount of data about SME that used to build company profiles.  They expected to see that theproject can produce an ideal company profile and matrix that matches the company profile toeach benchmark area.Some other researchers proposed some techniques that may be helpful for solve this kindof questions.   
In this paper,  the author has proposed a clustering approach for financialdata  analysis.   The  author  implemented  K-means clustering  as  the  partitioning  method, DBSCAN as a density-based clustering and hierarchical agglomerative clustering fora time-based data stream.  In this paper, the author used document frequency (DF), termfrequency (TF), and inverse document frequency (IDF) as the similarity measure to clusterthe  text  format  E-business  contents.   Other papers also showed how to use differentsimilarity measures (i.e. Euclidean distance, dynamic time warping, Pearson correlation, ...) toperform clustering based on the input type.
